#Linear Regression Project
Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement Linear Regression from scratch using Python. The goal is to predict the profit of a city based on its population using the gradient descent optimization algorithm.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training using gradient descent, and prediction for new data points. A simple scatter plot visualizes the relationship between population and profit, as well as the linear regression model's best-fit line.

Features
Data Loading: Reads data from a CSV file containing population and sales information.
Cost Function: Measures how well the model fits the data using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Gradient Descent: Optimizes the linear regression model by adjusting parameters using gradient descent.
Prediction: Makes predictions for new population values.
Visualization: Plots the dataset and the linear regression line.
Requirements
Before running the code, make sure to install the required dependencies:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
ipywidgets (for interactive widgets)
To install the dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt
text
Copy code
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
ipywidgets
Steps to Run the Project
1. Download or Clone the Repository
Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-project.git
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd linear-regression-project
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Prepare the Dataset
You need a CSV file (data.csv) for the dataset with at least two columns: Population and Sales.

Example of data.csv:

csv
Copy code
Population,Sales
6.1101,17.592
5.5277,9.1302
8.5186,13.662
7.0032,11.854
...
Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as your Python script or update the file path in the code accordingly.

5. Run the Code
To run the project, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will run the script, perform linear regression, and output predictions based on the model. A plot will also be displayed showing the dataset and the linear regression line.

6. Check the Output
The code will print the following:

The cost at each iteration of the gradient descent.
The final values of parameters (weights and bias).
Predictions for specific population values (e.g., for population 35,000 and 70,000).
A plot will show the population vs. sales data points, and the fitted linear regression line.

Code Explanation
main.py
Data Loading:
The dataset is loaded using pandas.
The data is split into features (x_train) and labels (y_train).
Cost Function:
The cost function computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted sales and actual sales.
Gradient Descent:
The gradient descent algorithm is used to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating the parameters (weights and bias).
Prediction:
After training the model, predictions are made for specific population values.
Visualization:
The model's predictions are plotted on top of the data points.
